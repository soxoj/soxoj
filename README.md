### Hi there 👋

I am an **OSINT enthusiast** with a background in cybersecurity and software development. 🔐 

⚒️ I started getting into OSINT in 2015 by playing CTFs and ARGs and making information-gathering and processing tools ([check this list](https://github.com/stars/soxoj/lists/my-osint-tools)).

🎙️ Since 2018 I've been talking about OSINT, search methods, and privacy at public events. You can look at some of my talks in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-6osVePbwJa2Tp2Bc2EUI1p).

🕵🏽 Currently, I am head of the OSINT Center of Excellence in [Social Links](https://sociallinks.io/). Guys from my department conduct investigations, teach OSINT and help to develop new methods and tools.
