### Hi there üëã

I am **OSINT enthusiast** with a background in cybersecurity and software development. üîê 

‚öíÔ∏è I started getting into OSINT in 2015, by making tools for information gathering and processing. Check the links below or visit [my repositories page](https://github.com/soxoj?tab=repositories).

üéôÔ∏è Since 2018 I've been talking about OSINT, search methods, and privacy at public events. You can look at some of my talks on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-6osVePbwJa2Tp2Bc2EUI1p).

üé• Later I founded the OSINT mindset community (2020 - [first post](https://t.me/osint_mindset/5), 2022 - [first meetup](https://t.me/osint_mindset/94)). The community has 15K subscribers, almost 4K members of [Investigation Forum](https://t.me/+GMxoDCvLO0k0MWRi), and dozens of active members and speakers. You can watch records of talks from [monthly meetups on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-7A2tKggMryk18tbwC7jLhX), listen OSINT mindset [podcasts on platforms](https://osint-mindset.mave.digital/), and read the excellent [wiki on Gitbook](https://osint-mindset.gitbook.io).

üíº Currently, I lead a team of OSINT experts in the Center of Excellence of Social Links: we conduct investigations, teach OSINT, and help to develop new methods and tools.

‚úçÔ∏è Some of my articles and guides you can find in the Telegram channel of [OSINT mindset](https://t.me/osint_mindset) community and here on GitHub.
