### Hi there 👋

I am an **OSINT enthusiast** with a background in cybersecurity and software development. 🔐 

⚒️ I started getting into OSINT in 2015 by playing CTFs and ARGs and making information-gathering and processing tools ([check this list](https://github.com/stars/soxoj/lists/my-osint-tools)).

🎙️ Since 2018 I've been talking about OSINT, search methods, and privacy at public events. You can look at some of my talks in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskYWMG4mV-6osVePbwJa2Tp2Bc2EUI1p).

🕵🏽 Currently, I am CPO in [Social Links](https://sociallinks.io/). I initially set up the SL OSINT Center of Excellence, where SMEs conducted investigations, taught OSINT, and contributed to development of new methods and tools. Now, I'm focused on driving the growth of cutting-edge OSINT investigation tools.
